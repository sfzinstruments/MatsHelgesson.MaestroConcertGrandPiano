# The Maestro Concert Grand Piano

This is a sampled reproduction of a Yamaha CF-3 grand
piano from the early 90s. It was chromatically sampled,
to maintain the tempered tuning.

# Technical

The Giga file is 985 mb.
Maestro Concert Grand contains 452 stereo samples.
It was recorded with a pair of Neumann KM84 microphones
in X/y stereo. x/y provides excellent mono compatibility.

The samples are sorted in 5 velocity layers, of which
velocity 0-29 are piano, 30-59 are mezzo piano, 60-89
are mezzo forte, 90-108 are forte and 109-127
fortissimo.

Maestro Concert Grand is the second sample set with pedal
up and down sounds separate from the key samples. It gives
you, the artist, the choice of adding additional pedal
noise in your recordings for added realism. They are
located in a second patch, below the piano key range, at
midi key number 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17.

**note**: This is changed with Concert Grand v2, which has
separate versions of the piano, and additional release
samples in four velocities, adding 352 samples.
